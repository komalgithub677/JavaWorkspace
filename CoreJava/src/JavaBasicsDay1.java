			System.out.println("2.Java has an Jdk , Jre and the Jvm ");
			System.out.println("3.Jdk provides the tools like the compiler ,Jvm and libraries for platform independent");
			System.out.println("4.Jvm executes the bytecode and makes java platfrom independent");
			System.out.println("4.Jdk perform the syntax checking with the help of compiler");
			System.out.println("5.Jdk convert the source code to the byte code");
			System.out.println("6.Jre converts the byte code to the machine code or the native code");
			System.out.println("7.Jre has an interpreter with the help of interpreter would jump on that line where error is present ");

			//Searching 
			System.out.println("1.Searching in java means finding the location of element in a collection of array");
			System.out.println("2.The most common Searching techniques in java are Linear Search and Binary SEarch");
			System.out.println("3.Linear search checks every elements in list one by one until the target is not found");
			System.out.println("4.Linear search is simple but not very efficient for large datasets");
			System.out.println("5.Binary search works only on sorted arryas or collections.");
			System.out.println("6.Binary search reapeatedly divides the array in half to find the target element.");
			System.out.println("7.Binary search is faster than the linera search beacause it reduces the search range with each step.");
			System.out.println("8.Java provides the built in method Arrays.binarySearch() for binary search.");
			System.out.println("9.Searching can also be done using like ArrayLists ,Hashmap , or Hashset.");
			System.out.println("10.Efficient searching improves the performance of the programs that handle large amounts of the data.");
			
			//Sorting 
			System.out.println("Sorting in java means arraging the elements in the specific order.");
			System.out.println("Sorting helps oraganising dat and makes searching faster and easier");
			System.out.println("Java supports differen sorting techniques such as Bubble sort , Selection sort ,Insertio sort ,Merge Sort , and Quick Sort.");
			System.out.println("Bubble sort repetedly sorts adjacents element if they are in wrong order");
			System.out.println("Selection sort selects the smallest element and places it in it's correct position one by one.");
			System.out.println("Insertion sort builds the sorted list by inserting one element at a time in the correct Places.");
			System.out.println("Merge sort divides the array into halfs and merge them back together ");
			System.out.println("Quick sort picks a pivot element and partitions the array into smaller and larger elements recursively");
			System.out.println("Java also provides the built-in methods like Arrays.sort() and the collections.sort() for sorting arrays and lists.");
			System.out.println("Efficient sorting improves the performance of the programs that handle large datasets.");
			
			//String
			 System.out.println("Strings in java are collections of characters which are enclosed in double quotes");
			 System.out.println("Java Strings are immutable,meaning there values cannot be changed");	
			 System.out.println("In java Strings can be created by using string Literals or by using the new keyword.");	
			 System.out.println("In java length method is used to find out the number of characters in string");	
			 System.out.println("Java provides many built in string methods like toUppercase(), toLowerCase(), and concat().");	
			 System.out.println("The equals method is used to compare the content of the two strings.");	
			 System.out.println("The == oprator compares the string reference not there actual content.");	
			 System.out.println("The Strings can be joined together using the + operator and the concat() method.");	
			 System.out.println("The StringBuilder and the StringBuffer are used to create the mutable strings in java.");	
			 System.out.println("You can convert the others data types to strings using methods like String.valueOf()  or concatenation.");
			 
			 //Student Info
			 System.out.println("1.My name is Komal Narawade");
			  System.out.println("2.I am belonging  from Beed");
			  System.out.println("3.Currently i am pursuing B.E in computer science");
			  System.out.println("4.I am passionate about the technology and programming. ");
			  System.out.println("5.I enjoy learning new skills in web development and java");
			  System.out.println("6.I beleive in continuous learning and self-improvement");
			  System.out.println("7.My goal is to become a skilled software developer");
			  System.out.println("8.I like working on creative and meaningful projects");
			  System.out.println("9.In my free time , I enjoy reading and learning about AI tools");
